# **Module 21, Challenge - building a blockchain based monetary system for use in Mars planetary colony.**


Scenario - Fintech professional, chosen to lead a project to develop a new monetary system of exchange for interplanetary colonization.

Objective - develop a blockchain technology based monetary system. 

Product - Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. 
> cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.)
> fungible token.
> ERC-20 compliant. 
> blockchain crowdsale / initial coin offerring (ICO).

### **Dependencies**

This challenge leverages Solidity version 0.5.5 with the following IDE (Integrated Development Environment):

* [REMIX_IDE](https://remix-project.org/) - a no-setup tool with a GUI for developing smart contracts.
* [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) - a private Ethereum blockchain environment that allows to you emulate the Ethereum blockchain so that you can interact with smart contracts in your own private blockchain.
* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain; enables access to Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.
